This is just a simple app using Strava API
Plot a map of a recent activity you did (most recent one prior to August 12)

Follow these instructions to get it working:

You should be able to run this app locally if you follow these steps:

First, create a virtual environment with python2.7, for example using 
conda create -n my_virtual_env python=2.7
 
From within the recommender_app_gcloud directory, type this in the command line:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you're in a virtual env and you've installed the required packages

Now make sure you have secrets.txt one dir up from simplest.py

Then type:
python simplest.py
And if it works, you should be able to navigate your browser to:
http://127.0.0.1:33508/

And click!
